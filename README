WD User Land Demonstration
==========================

This directory contains some applications and libraries to demonstrate how a

WrapDrive application can be constructed.


As a demo, we try to make it simple and clear for understanding. It is not

supposed to be used in business scenario.


The directory contains the following elements:

wd.[ch]
	A demonstration UADK fundamental library which wraps the basic
	operations to the UACCE device.

wd_adapter.[ch]
	User driver adaptor for wd.[ch]

wd_utils.[ch]
	Some utitlities function used by WD and its drivers

drv/*
	User drivers. It helps to fulfill the semantic of wd.[ch] for
	particular hardware

test/*
	Test applications to use the wrapdrive library


Build in samples/warpdrive (for the case of PC host): ::
        ./autogen.sh
        ./conf.sh       # or simply ./configure if you build on target system
        make

Then you can get test_hisi_zip in the test subdirectory. Copy it to the target
system and make sure the hisi_zip driver is enabled (the major and minor of
the uacce chrdev can be gotten from the dmesg or sysfs), and run: ::
        mknod /dev/ua1 c <major> <minior>
        test/test_hisi_zip -z < data > data.zip
        test/test_hisi_zip -g < data > data.gzip
